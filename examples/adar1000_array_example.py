# Create handle for an array of 4 ADAR1000s with the channels configured in a 4x4 array.
#
# Instantiation arguments:
#     chip_ids: Must match the ADAR1000 labels in the device tree
#
#     device_map: Maps the ADAR1000s to their location in the array. See below:
#         (ADAR1000 #1)    (ADAR1000 #2)
#         (ADAR1000 #3)    (ADAR1000 #4)
#
#     element_map: Maps the element numbers in the array. See below:
#         (El. #1)    (El. #2)    (El. #3)    (El. #4)
#         (El. #5)    (El. #6)    (El. #7)    (El. #8)
#         (El. #9)    (El. #10)   (El. #11)   (El. #12)
#         (El. #13)   (El. #14)   (El. #15)   (El. #16)
#
#     device_element_map: Maps the ADAR1000s to specific elements in the array, in channel order. See below:
#         ADAR1000 #1:
#             Ch. #1 -> El. #5
